          <h5 className="font-semibold mt-2">User Accounts</h5>
          <p>
            In order to use most aspects of the Services, you must register for
            and maintain an active personal user Services account (
            <strong>“Account”</strong>). You must be at least 18 years of age,
            or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different than
            18), to obtain an Account. Account registration requires you to
            submit to Last Minute Wellness certain personal information, such as
            your name, address, government issued identification, and phone
            numbers, as well as at least one valid payment method (either a
            credit card or accepted payment partner). If you assign other third
            parties to access your Account on your behalf and to order Services
            on your Account, those third parties must also set up Accounts,
            provide similar personal information, but they may be assigned as
            delegates (<strong>“Delegates”</strong>) to your Account. You and
            each Delegate agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date
            information in your and their respective Accounts. Your failure to
            maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information,
            including having an invalid or expired payment method on file, may
            result in your inability to access or use the Services. You are
            responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, even if
            performed by a Delegate on your behalf, and you agree to maintain
            the security and secrecy of your Account username and password at
            all times. Unless otherwise permitted by Last Minute Wellness in
            writing, you may only possess one Account, provided that you may
            authorize a Delegate to have access to your Account.
          </p>
          <h5 className="font-semibold mt-2">User Requirements and Conduct</h5>

            18. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your Account to any
            other person or entity, except where you authorize a Delegate to
            have access to your Account. You agree to comply with all applicable
            laws when accessing or using the Services, and you may only access
            or use the Services for lawful purposes and in accordance with these
            Last Minute Wellness Terms. You will not, in your use of the

            personal injury, or property damage, whether to the Third Party
            Provider or any other party, including Last Minute Wellness, its
            affiliates or any of their employees, agents or contractors. In
            certain instances, you may be asked to provide proof of identity or
            other method of identity verification to access or use the Services,
            and you agree that you may be denied access to or use of the
            Services if you refuse to provide proof of identity or other method
            of identity verification. A Third Party Provider may also require
            you to agree to additional terms and conditions governing their
            provision of services to you.

            Premises Safety Requirements and Service Provider Refusal Rights
          </h5>
          <p>
            Certain Services may require Third Party Provider to come to your
            home or another location of your choosing. You are solely
            responsible for ensuring that the premises where Services are to be
            performed for you are safe, sanitary, and secure. This includes,
            without limitation, providing adequate lighting, clear access
            pathways, and a hazard-free working environment. If a Third Party
            Provider determines, in their reasonable discretion, that the
            premises are unsafe or unfit for the provision of Services, the
            Third Party Provider may decline to provide or may suspend the
            provision of Services. In such circumstances, you agree that any
            prepaid sums will be forfeited and no refund will be provided.
            Repeated occurrences may result in the suspension or termination of
            your Account.
          </p>
          <h5 className="font-semibold mt-2">Pets</h5>
          <p>
            For the safety of a Third Party Provider, you are responsible for
            properly securing any animals under your care and control (whether
            or not they are actually owned by you) located on your premises
            where the Services are rendered with a leash, harness, crate /
            carrier, containment in a separate closed room, or through other
            means. You are also responsible for any damage that the animal
            causes to the Third Party Provider or to their property. You may be
            subject to a Damages Fee (as defined below) for any property damage,
            personal injury or other claim, loss, liability or damage caused by
            an animal that is under your care and control (whether or not they
            are actually owned by you) located on your premises where the
            Services are rendered.
          </p>
          <h5 className="font-semibold mt-2">Mobility Assistance</h5>
          <p>
            If you request <strong>“Mobility Assistance”</strong> to facilitate
            any part of the Services where Third Party Provider agrees to
            provide you with assistance prior, during or after the provision of
            the Services, you acknowledge and agree that neither Last Minute
            Wellness nor the Third Party Provider is responsible for any injury
            or incident that may arise out of the Mobility Assistance provided
            by the Third Party Provider.

            affiliates may send you commercial electronic messages (including
            email, SMS or push notifications, where applicable) as part of the
            normal business operation of your use of the Services and to send
            you marketing and promotional messages about any of Last Minute
            Wellness’s Applications, products or services. Where it may be
            impracticable (including for push notifications) to include an
            unsubscribe mechanism in certain commercial electronic messages, you
            may opt-out of receiving commercial electronic messages from Last
            Minute Wellness at any time. You also acknowledge that opting out of
            receiving electronic messages may impact your use of the Services.

          <h5 className="font-semibold mt-2">Promotional Codes</h5>
          <p>
            A Last Minute Wellness affiliate may, in its sole discretion, create
            promotional codes that may be redeemed for Account credit, or other
            features or benefits related to a Third Party Provider’s Services,
            subject to any additional terms that the Last Minute Wellness
            affiliate establishes on a per promotional code basis (
            <strong>“Promo Codes”</strong>). You agree that Promo Codes: (i)
            must be used for the intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful
            manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any
            manner, or made available to the general public (whether posted to a
            public form or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by the Last
            Minute Wellness affiliate; (iii) may, as permitted by law, be
            disabled by Last Minute Wellness or its affiliate at any time
            without liability to Last Minute Wellness or its affiliate; (iv) may
            only be used pursuant to the specific terms that the Last Minute
            Wellness affiliate establishes for such Promo Code; (v) are not
            valid for cash; and (vi) may expire prior to your use. Last Minute

            features or benefits obtained through the use of Promo Codes by you
            or any other user in the event that the Last Minute Wellness
            reasonably determines or believes that the use or redemption of the
            Promo Code was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the
            applicable Promo Code terms or these Last Minute Wellness Terms.

          <p>
            You agree to maintain a valid, unexpired credit card or other
            accepted payment method on file with your Account at all times. By
            using the Services, you authorize Last Minute Wellness and its

            amounts payable in connection with the Services, including all
            applicable Third Party Charges, cancellation fees, rescheduling
            fees, Damages Fees, and any other amounts owed under these Terms.
            You acknowledge and agree that Services must be prepaid in full at
            the time of booking and that Last Minute Wellness is authorized to
            charge your payment method without further notice for all such
            amounts.
          </p>
          <p>
            You understand that use of the Services will result in charges to
            you for the services or goods you receive from a Third Party
            Provider (<strong>“Third Party Charges”</strong>). Payment of the
            Third Party Charges shall be considered the same as payment made
            directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Applicable taxes will
            be added to Third Party Charges where required by law. Third Party
            Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise
            determined by Last Minute Wellness or as set forth in these Last
            Minute Wellness Terms.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            All Third Party Charges are due immediately upon booking a service
            appointment and payment will be facilitated by Last Minute Wellness
            or a Last Minute Wellness affiliate using the preferred payment
            method designated in your Account, after which you will be sent a
            receipt. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be
            expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that
            Last Minute Wellness or a Last Minute Wellness affiliate may, on
            behalf of Third Party Provider, use a secondary payment method in
            your Account, if available.
          </p>
          <p>
            You acknowledge that Last Minute Wellness or a Last Minute Wellness
            affiliate may establish or adjust Third Party Charges for any or all
            services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any
            time at the direction of the Third Party Provider or otherwise in
            Last Minute Wellness or the Last Minute Wellness affiliate’s
            discretion, including in certain circumstances such as where you
            choose an additional service that incurs an additional charge. Last
            Minute Wellness will use reasonable efforts to ensure that it or the
            Last Minute Wellness affiliate informs you of Third Party Charges
            that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Third
            Party Charges incurred under your Account. You acknowledge that the
            fact that a payment card statement may reflect a charge from Last
            Minute Wellness or a Last Minute Wellness affiliate, does not
            necessarily mean that Last Minute Wellness or the Last Minute
            Wellness affiliate sold an item or service, but rather that Last
            Minute Wellness or the Last Minute Wellness Affiliate facilitated
            payment processing, and that the merchant stated on your receipt is
            the actual seller.

            <h5 className="font-semibold mt-2">Gratuities</h5>
            <p>
              This payment structure is intended to compensate the Third Party
              Provider for the services or goods provided. You understand and
              agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a
              gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with
              services or goods obtained through the Services, you are under no
              obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have
              received services or goods obtained through the Services, you will
              have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional
              feedback about your Third Party Provider.
            </p>
            <h5 className="font-semibold mt-2">Cancellations and Refunds</h5>
            <p>
              You may elect to cancel your request for Services from a Third
              Party Provider at any time. If you cancel your request for
              Services greater than forty-eight (48) hours before your scheduled
              appointment you will receive a full refund of all prepaid amounts.
              If you cancel your request for Services less than forty-eight (48)
              hours but before twenty-four (24) hours prior to such Third Party
              Provider’s scheduled booking you will forfeit 50% of your prepaid
              sums. If you cancel a booking with less than twenty-four (24)
              hours' notice, you agree that you will forfeit 100% of your
              prepaid sums. There will be no refunds for missed scheduled
              bookings.
            </p>
            <p>
              If any Services provided by a Third Party Provider fail or are
              cancelled for reasons that Last Minute Wellness determines, acting
              reasonably, are attributed to you (for example, without
              limitation, you provided an incorrect address or you were unable
              to provide access to the premises to the Third Party Provider, you
              were unable to provide a safe working environment, or you
              cancelled for any reason, including in respect of any emergency
              affecting you), you will be charged a fee no more than the full
              price for Services ordered from the Third Party Provider. If the
              Services are cancelled for any reason by the Third Party Provider
              other than where Last Minute Wellness determines, acting
              reasonably, that such reason is attributed to you, you will
              receive a full refund of your prepaid sums for the booking.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you require a correction to be made to any Third Party Charge
              you incurred, you must notify Last Minute Wellness in writing
              within 10 days after the Third Party Charge was invoiced after
              which Last Minute Wellness will have no further responsibility and
              you waive your right to later dispute the amounts charged.
            </p>
            <h5 className="font-semibold mt-2">Damages Fees</h5>
            <p>
              Last Minute Wellness may charge you a fee if, during your use of
              the Services, you have caused property damage, personal injury or
              caused any other loss, claim, liability or damage to the Third
              Party Provider or to their personal property (
              <strong>“Claim“</strong>, and the fees associated with the Claim
              is the “Damages Fee”). The amount of such Damages Fee shall be
              determined, in Last Minute Wellness’s sole discretion, based on
              the type of damage and the severity. Last Minute Wellness reserves
              the right to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages
              prior to processing a Damages Fee. In the event that a Third Party
              Provider reports a Claim, and such Claim is verified by Last
              Minute Wellness in its reasonable discretion, Last Minute Wellness
              reserves the right to facilitate payment for the reasonable cost
              of such Damages Fee associated with the Claim on behalf of the
              Third Party Provider using your payment method designated in your
              Account. Such amounts will be transferred by Last Minute Wellness
              to the applicable Third Party Provider and are non-refundable.
            </p>

              charges, including without limitation, for transactions that could
              not be completed properly, arising out of or in connection with
              your failure to comply with these Last Minute Wellness Terms.

              These Last Minute Wellness Terms shall be exclusively governed by
              and construed in accordance with the laws of the province of

            <p>
              IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION REQUIREMENT
              CAREFULLY. YOU WILL HAVE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH ARBITRATION.
              YOU WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO GET MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF THROUGH A
              COURT PROCEEDING.{" "}
            </p>
            <h5 className="font-semibold mt-2">ARBITRATION REQUIREMENT</h5>
            <p>
              You are free to get advice or representation from a lawyer about
              this arbitration requirement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unless prohibited by law, all disputes arising out of or relating
              in any way to: i) these Last Minute Wellness Terms, ii) the
              Services, iii) your access to or use of the Applications, or iv)
              advertisements, promotions or oral or written statements related
              to the Applications or any other Last Minute Wellness branded
              product or Services will be finally and conclusively adjudicated
              and resolved by arbitration under the Arbitration Rules (
              <strong>“ADRIC Rules”</strong>) of the ADR Institute of Canada,
              Inc. (<strong>“ADRIC”</strong>), except as modified here. The
              arbitration will be in English. The arbitration will be held in
              the City of Calgary, however, that attendance of the parties may
              occur remotely by telephone or Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will have to pay some fees to arbitrate, as described in the
              ADRIC Rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, before beginning the arbitration, the party with the
              claim will first try to informally negotiate with the other party,
              in good faith, a resolution of the dispute for not less than 30
              days but no more than 45 days unless extended by agreement. During
              the negotiation period, any otherwise applicable limitation period
              will be tolled (temporarily suspended).
            </p>
            <p>
              Where you allege claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment,
              you may choose to bring those specific claims in court instead of
              arbitration. Last Minute Wellness agrees to honour your choice of
              forum with respect to your individual sexual harassment or sexual
              assault claim but in doing so Last Minute Wellness does not waive
              the enforceability of any other part of this section 7.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nothing here prevents you from filing a claim with a government
              agency.
            </p>
            <p>
              This arbitration requirement survives: (i) the termination of this
              Agreement and (ii) the bankruptcy of any party. If any part of it
              is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the other parts remain in
              force.

              If any provision of these Last Minute Wellness Terms is held to be
              illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, under any
              law, such provision or part thereof shall to that extent be deemed
              not to form part of these Last Minute Wellness Terms but the

              these Last Minute Wellness Terms shall not be affected. In that
              event, the parties shall replace the illegal, invalid or
              unenforceable provision or part thereof with a provision or part
              thereof that is legal, valid and enforceable and that has, to the
              greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the illegal, invalid
